# Attestation Framework For EVM Compatible Blockchains
Very creative name, I know.  This started out as a POAP alternative, but being an abstraction nut, I turned it into a general attestation framework.  Currently, there are two attestation types:  Freeform, and the aforememntioned POAP alternative, which is formatted as name, place, and date for each event.

Sorry, I'm terrible at documentation.  Somebody help, please!

TODO:

- Figure out mutability:  what, if anything, can be changed by whom
- Upgradability?  
- Finish Front End
    - css framework
    - QR Code reader
-add command line options to deploy script for key and url
